1. Define Monolithic architecture:
    Answer: Monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for designing software programs. Monolithic applications are complex applications that encompasses several tightly coupled functions or coponents in the same codebase.

2. Explain microservices in your own understanding
    Answer: Microservices unlike monolithic is loosely coupled, it an application use to break down homogeneous struction into smaller sizes independent pieces of programs which is easiser to understand and manage. 
    In a nutshell, the microservice architectural style is a method of developing a single application as a collection of small services, each running in its own process and communicating via lightweight mechanisms, typically an HTTP resource API.
    The entire functionality of a microservices architecture is divided into independently deployable modules that communicate with one another via defined methods called APIs or message brokers. Each service has its own scope and can be independently updated, deployed and scaled.

3. Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?
    Microservices architecture is more appealing to me due to following microservices approach offers tangible benefits including an increase in scalability, flexibility, agility, and other significant advantages. 

    1. Maintenance is simplified: A microservice application is easier to understand and manage because it is divided into smaller and simpler components. You simply focus on a specific service that is related to a business goal that you have.
    2. Increased scalability: Scaling and adding new capabilities to applications will be much easier with the microservices architecture. If one intend to create a large application with multiple modules and user journeys, a microservice pattern is the best way to go. Another advantage of using microservices is that each component can be scaled independently. So the entire process is more cost and time effective than with monoliths when the whole application has to be scaled even if there is no need for it. 
    3. Service isolation: Any flaw in a microservices application affects only one service and not the entire solution. As a result, all changes and experiments are carried out with fewer risks and errors.
    4. Flexibility: Because each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, developers have the option of selecting the best technology stack and development approach for each service. Engineering teams can build and deploy new functionalities separately in each service without a need to redesign the whole solution.

4. Is Nodejs a multithreaded language? 
    Answer: Node.js itself is a multithreaded language that support ssynchronous methods using the hidden threads through Libuv library which handles operations such like reading files from a disk or making network requests, although it run javascript code as a singlethreaded. 

5. What does REPL stand for?
    Answer: Read Evaluate Print Loop. A programming language that help a convert a single expression entered by user into a complete result to the console.

6. Create a javascript file and inside the file add code that will log in to the console, your name, your preferred programming language, and where you see yourself in the next 1 year
